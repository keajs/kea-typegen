# Go Rewrite TODO

## Current state

- `rewrite/` is now the start of the real Go rewrite, separate from the one-off PoCs under `poc/`.
- The CLI at [`rewrite/cmd/kea-typegen-go/main.go`](/Users/marius/Projects/Kea/kea-typegen/rewrite/cmd/kea-typegen-go/main.go) still opens TypeScript projects through the `typescript-go` API, and it now has two paths:
  - native `check`, `write`, and polling `watch` subcommands with `.kearc`/`tsconfig.json` discovery, root/types path resolution, cache restore/writeback, delete support, single-file mode, generated `*Type.ts` writes, object-path insertion, and local logic type import / `kea<LogicType>` source repairs
  - `-format report`: the raw inspection JSON
  - `-format model`: a Go-native normalized logic model
  - `-format typegen`: a reduced `.typegen`-style TypeScript interface
- The scanner is source-text based. It now handles both `kea({ ... })` and `kea([ ... ])` builder syntax and records the input kind.
- The inspector now walks all top-level logic sections instead of only `actions`/`reducers`/`selectors`.
- For builder sections where `typescript-go` reports the builder argument too loosely, the inspector falls back to syntax-guided object member extraction. This now gives useful results for `actions`, `reducers`, `selectors`, `listeners`, `events`, and `forms` in builder mode.
- A first Go-native semantic layer now exists in [`rewrite/internal/keainspect/model.go`](/Users/marius/Projects/Kea/kea-typegen/rewrite/internal/keainspect/model.go). It currently normalizes:
  - `path`
  - `props`
  - `key`
  - `actions`
  - object-style `true` action shorthands into literal `{ value: true }` payloads
  - `defaults`
  - `reducers`
  - `windowValues` into reducer/value/selectors state
  - `loaders` into reducer state plus synthetic request/success/failure actions
  - `lazyLoaders` into reducer state plus synthetic request/success/failure actions
  - `connect` for local imported logics by recursively inspecting the referenced source file and reusing the normalized actions/values
  - local `connect` targets reached through default imports such as `import github from './githubLogic'`
  - local `connect` / imported `logic.actionTypes.*` target expressions reached through namespace imports such as `github.githubLogic` and `github.githubLogic()`, while still reusing the connected logic's normalized imports
  - symbol-backed `connect.actions`/`connect.values` recovery from connected wrapper members, including widened connected values such as `isLoading: boolean`
  - external `connect.actions` with a listener-signature fallback when the target logic is not locally inspectable
  - external connected action payload refinement from local listener signatures when symbol-return payloads are truncated, avoiding `Record<...>` payload members in samples such as `routerConnectLogic`
  - `listeners`
  - source-guided recovery for computed `listeners` keys that point at imported `logic.actionTypes.*` references, reusing the imported logic's normalized payload/import data
  - `sharedListeners`
  - `events`
  - explicit selectors, including source-probed recovery for truncated final tuple members such as `sbla`
  - builder selectors with block-bodied final functions when `typescript-go` falls back to `any`, such as `sortedRepositories`
  - source-guided alias preservation for `actions`, `defaults`, `reducers`, and explicit selector return annotations when `typescript-go` expands away useful ownership names
  - reduced plugin-produced fields for object `inline`/`form`, builder `forms`, and builder `typedForm`
  - source-backed builder `forms` default-shape recovery for spread-heavy defaults, keeping full field coverage such as `key39` and literal defaults such as `asd: true`
- A first reduced emitter now exists in [`rewrite/internal/keainspect/emit.go`](/Users/marius/Projects/Kea/kea-typegen/rewrite/internal/keainspect/emit.go). It prints:
  - `actionCreators`
  - `actionKeys`
  - `actionTypes`
  - `actions`
  - `asyncActions`
  - `custom`
  - `defaults`
  - aggregate `reducer`
  - `listeners`
  - `key`
  - `path`
  - `pathString`
  - `props`
  - `reducers`
  - `events`
  - aggregate `selector`
  - `selectors`
  - `sharedListeners`
  - `values`
  - `_isKea`
  - `_isKeaWithKey`
  - `__keaTypeGenInternalExtraInput`
- Import/reference gathering now combines normalized type-string scanning with local-module export discovery:
  - direct named imports and exported local types from the source file
  - direct default-import and namespace-import ownership reuse for qualified type references such as `Foo.Bar` and `ts.Node`
  - mixed default-plus-named import clauses now contribute both ownership reuse and fallback export discovery
  - transitive exported type names from already-imported relative modules, including namespace members and simple re-exports
  - exported type names from already-imported packages by scanning installed `.d.ts` files under `node_modules` when the current source does not spell the type import directly
  - existing imports attached by earlier normalization passes are now treated as authoritative so connected/local ownership is not re-resolved onto unrelated package exports
  - source-guided alias preservation now lets the reduced emitter keep richer ownership such as `L1`, `A2`, `D6`, `R6`, `Bla`, `ExportedApi.RandomThing`, `NodeJS.Timeout`, `S7`, and `RandomThing` in `samples/autoImportLogic.ts`, and the emitter now prints namespace/default type imports when ownership depends on them
- Reusable `typescript-go` API transport code now lives in [`rewrite/internal/tsgoapi/client.go`](/Users/marius/Projects/Kea/kea-typegen/rewrite/internal/tsgoapi/client.go).
- Preferred `tsgo` binary discovery now prefers an actually present repo binary, falls back to `tsgo`/`tsgo-upstream` on `PATH`, and reports missing-binary failures explicitly instead of silently defaulting to a dead `poc/.../tsgo-upstream` path.

- `samples/builderLogic.ts`: builder syntax for `path`, `actions`, `reducers`, `selectors`, `listeners`, `events`, `lazyLoaders`, reduced `forms` actions/state/selectors/imports
- `samples/builderLogic.ts`: block-bodied selector return recovery for `sortedRepositories`

- Reduced `.typegen` emission is now verified end-to-end for `samples/propsLogic.ts`.
- Basic type import collection is verified on `samples/builderLogic.ts` (`Repository` from `./types`).
- Unit coverage now also verifies default/namespace import ownership (`default as Foo`, `import type * as ts`) plus default-imported local `connect` targets.
- Reduced `.typegen` emission now also synthesizes loader actions/defaults for `samples/logic.ts`, including `Session` import collection from the source file.
- Reduced `.typegen` emission for `samples/logic.ts` now also includes `listeners`, `sharedListeners`, `events`, and the `BreakPointFunction` import from `kea`.
- Reduced `.typegen` emission now also covers:
  - `samples/windowValuesLogic.ts` reducer/value/selectors parity for `windowHeight`/`windowWidth`
  - `samples/routerConnectLogic.ts` typed connected `locationChanged` actions via connected wrapper symbol recovery plus `kea-router/lib/types` import collection
  - `samples/routerConnectLogic.ts` local-listener refinement of truncated connected payload members such as `hashParams: Record<string, any>`

  - `samples/autoImportLogic.ts` source-guided alias preservation for `L1`/`A2`/`D6`/`R6`/`Bla`/`ExportedApi.RandomThing`/`NodeJS.Timeout`
  - `samples/autoImportLogic.ts` authoritative connected import reuse so `Repository` stays owned by `./types` instead of being spuriously re-imported from package scanning
  - `samples/autoImportLogic.ts` selector recovery for both truncated `sbla` and explicit alias return types such as `randomSpecifiedReturn`
  - `samples/githubImportLogic.ts` and `samples/githubImportViaWildcardLogic.ts` imported listener action typing for computed `logic.actionTypes.*` keys
  - `samples/complexLogic.ts` literal `true` action payload typing instead of `any`
- Native CLI source-edit helpers now have focused tests for:
  - `.kearc` path/bool resolution into Go app options
  - adding missing `import type { logicType } from './logicType'` plus `kea<logicType>` annotations
  - inserting missing object `path` declarations for `--write-paths`

## Immediate next steps

1. Replace the remaining source-scanned import gathering with symbol-backed ownership data from `typescript-go`, especially when the right owner is only available semantically rather than from explicit source text:
   - inferred aliases that are not spelled in the source
   - package/global/plugin helper types beyond installed-package export scanning
   - ownership-preserving reuse inside connected external logics beyond the current authoritative-import reuse and the new explicit default/namespace-owner reuse
2. Tighten `connect` beyond the current recursive local-file path:
   - broader target-expression support beyond the current identifier / call / namespace-property / default-import cases
   - connected values/actions should preserve ownership/import fidelity from declaration sources rather than combining symbol-backed member types with import scanning heuristics
   - external connected payload fidelity should stop depending on local listener signatures when the symbol-return payload itself is truncated
3. Deepen plugin and typed-builder parity beyond the current reduced heuristics:
   - richer `kea-forms` selectors/action payload details and literal-preserving defaults
   - builder plugins whose semantics are not directly inspectable from the callsite
4. Keep closing the gap between the reduced emitter and real `kea-typegen` output for richer samples:
   - tighten formatting/parity details such as union ordering and other inferred-vs-explicit naming differences in `samples/autoImportLogic.ts`
   - add the remaining structural fields still missing from the reduced emitter beyond the new `actionKeys` / aggregate `reducer` / aggregate `selector` parity
5. Tighten the new native CLI parity layer:
   - replace string-based source edits with AST-backed rewrites so import/path repairs match JS formatting and broader syntax shapes
   - support the remaining JS write-mode flags that still do not have native behavior (`--convert-to-builders`, richer `--show-ts-errors` reporting)
   - broaden watch invalidation beyond the current polling loop and root-tree scanning

## Known gaps

- Code generation still exists only for a reduced subset of the final interface, although the emitter now also covers `actionKeys` plus aggregate `reducer`/`selector` fields.
- No plugin execution model yet.
- Builder syntax is detected and partially introspected, and `typedForm(...)` now has a reduced heuristic path, but custom builders are still mostly opaque without plugin-specific handling.
- Import gathering is still not fully symbol-backed. Local relative module export scanning, installed-package `.d.ts` export scanning, and source-guided named/default/namespace alias recovery now cover much more of the local case, but inferred ownership and some package/global/plugin helper types are still missing.
- Existing normalized imports now prevent some bad fallback resolutions, but ownership still depends on heuristics once a type has not already been attached by an earlier pass.
- Connect normalization now uses symbol-backed wrapper members for local imports, default-imported local targets, namespace-imported local targets, and simple package-provided logics, but more complex target expressions and fuller ownership/import fidelity still need work.
- Alias-preserving ownership is much better in richer files such as `samples/autoImportLogic.ts`, but still depends on source spelling; inferred-only aliases can still collapse to expanded forms.
- Plugin-produced fields now have reduced heuristics for a few known samples, including typed-form `custom`/`__keaTypeGenInternalExtraInput`, but there is still no general plugin execution or typegen hook model.
- Builder `forms` defaults are now much closer for local spread-heavy defaults, but imported spreads and broader expression shapes still fall back to heuristic type text.
- Explicit selector normalization is better for expression-bodied tuples, explicit return annotations, and simple block-bodied returns, but deeper alias-sensitive cases still need more work.
- `check` / `write` / polling `watch` now run natively, but source edits are still string-based rather than AST-backed, so formatting and edge-case syntax coverage are not yet fully JS-identical.
- `--convert-to-builders` is still unimplemented in the Go CLI path.
- `--show-ts-errors` does not yet reproduce the JS compiler-watch diagnostics output.
- The scanner currently assumes identifier-style top-level property keys and uses byte offsets from UTF-8 source text.
